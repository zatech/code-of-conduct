# ZATech Slack - Code of Conduct

“ZATech” in this document refers to the ZATech Slack organization at [https://zatech.slack.com/](https://zatech.slack.com/). “The administrators” refers to the administrators on this organization, which can be accessed [here](https://zatech.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins), or by accessing "Workspace Directory" in the top-right drop-down menu on the web, and from the settings button next to name and title select `Admins`. (You must be a member of the organization to view.)

## TL;DR

When posting:

* Avoid divisive topics, such as political or relgious debates
* All content must be family friendly and 'safe for work'
* Be polite and respectful, including to non-members
* Don't be self-promotional

In general:

* Do not harrass people
* Do not share personal information of others to people outside the community

This is a safe space, let's keep it that way.

## General guidelines

Be kind. Don't be snarky. Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.

When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."

Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith.

Eschew flamebait. Don't introduce flamewar topics unless you have something genuinely new to say. Avoid unrelated controversies and generic tangents.

Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work, thoughts or opinions. A good critical comment teaches us something.

## Channels

Our conversation is split into channels. Generally, any discussion should be related to the theme in the channel. You can infer the purpose of a channel by:

- Its name
- Its topic
- Its description

ZATech aims to provide a space for specific technical communities to gather, share and learn from each other. We have a mix of what we think of as 'on topic' channels (those that are clearly related to technology and of interest to technical professionals) and 'off topic' channels (those that are more generic, and might be interesting even to non-technical professionals.)

### On topic channels

Our main public channels are dedicated to specific technologies, programming languages, frameworks, and technical disciplines. For example [#php](https://zatech.slack.com/archives/C07AVU84V), [#typescript](https://zatech.slack.com/archives/C6CLD2STG), [#python](https://zatech.slack.com/archives/C07RJNL8N) etc. These spaces are intended for in-depth, focused discussions related to their respective topics.

There are also slightly adjacent channels such as [#jobpostings](https://zatech.slack.com/archives/C1RAZB24S) or [#freelance-discuss](https://zatech.slack.com/archives/C0JEGJ5AT) which provide value to our target audience of technical professionals.

### Off topic channels

We recognize the importance of more casual and generic online 3rd spaces. Therefore, we allow some "off topic" channels to exist. These range from region-based channels (e.g., #capetown) to sports such as #rugby or #f1 and so on.

These off-topic spaces are valuable for networking, community building, and providing a more relaxed environment for members to interact.

### Private channels

Private channels are invite-only, and often do not include any members of the Admin team. If you create or are invited to a private channel, you are still expected to follow our code of conduct. While we welcome any reports about private channels that break our code of conduct, we cannot directly moderate them by intervening in discussions or removing messages.

## No harrassment, online or offline

ZATech is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all ZATech spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and offline. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Some ZATech spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

## Unsolicited private messages (DMs)

While the community aims to be a place for members of the community to meet and connect, it's also important to respect each other's privacy. In general, it's polite to ask in a public channel for permission to DM another member before doing so.

We take a strong stance to any DM spam. If you send unsolicited self-promotional messages by DM to any of our members, you may be banned from our community without further warning.

## Conduct specific to job postings and recruitment activities

ZATech is first and foremost intended to be a safe space for people to talk, share and collaborate. Not somewhere they'll be solicited unless it's expressly requested. Therefore, the following are specific conditions regarding job postings and recruitment.

* Unsolicited recruiting of any sort is not allowed on ZATech under any circumstances. Cases of professional recruiters DMing member without their permission will be treated especially strictly and usually lead to an instant ban.
* Users (including admins) may not under any circumstances share personal details of ZATech members with recruiters without that user's explicit consent.
* Advertising an opportunity for which you are the employer is allowed within the [#jobpostings channel](https://zatech.slack.com/messages/jobpostings/). You should usually be owner or hiring manager of the posting, and at least be employed by company where the position is open. More information on this process is available on the [wiki](https://wiki.zatech.co.za/jobpostings).
* If you are a professional recruiter, you may not advertise your postings on ZATech. You may reach out to the admin team about having a sponsored post in the channel to help you find candidates. We regard professional recruiters as any person or entity who is paid source candidates for positions for another company, or earns a commission from those position being filled, including recruiting firms, private recruiters, EOR firms who assist their customers with HR, and any similar model.
* Opportunities must not, under any circumstances, use referral program links where the poster of the message could benefit, e.g. via earning a commission.
* If you want to advertise an opportunity for another company (e.g. for a friend, as a favour, without any reward), please rather ask someone from the company to join and post directly, or if that is impossible then ask the admin team for permission before posting and explain why.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of ZATech, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns there are a few methods for reporting. Administrators will respond as soon as they are able. If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. Listed from most public to most anonymous:

* Use the "Report an Issue" workflow in #asktheadmins
* Create a private channel with the admins
  * Create a private channel called `admins-$YOUR_USERNAME`, e.g. `admins-cdanvers`
  * Invite the admin team to your new private channel using `/invite @adminteam`
* DM an [administrator](https://zatech.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins)
* Submit an [anonymous report](https://zatech.co.za/report)

This code of conduct applies to ZATech spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of ZATech outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by ZATech members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from ZATech based on their past behavior, including behavior outside ZATech spaces and behavior towards people who are not members of the ZATech community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of ZATech members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Unacceptable Content

The ZATech community is a collection of professionals, as such it is expected that the content made available by members of the community should at all times adhere to the acceptable content policy. This policy is intended to protect the community's image, as well as the image of its members, through restrictions on certain classes of content which may be deemed to be unsuitable in a work or family context.

Links to content are deemed as acceptable as the content within.

Unacceptable content is content that is generally covered by South African law, including but not limited to:

 - Pornographic or sexually suggestive material, either in graphic or text form.
 - Depictions of physical or emotional abuse, either in graphic or text form.
 - Persecution of any individual as a result of their race, gender, religion or other physical traits.
 - Material intended to, without basis, harm the reputation of any individual whether a member or not.
 - Unsolicited advertising with the exception of job offers in the [#jobpostings](https://zatech.slack.com/messages/jobpostings/) channel.
 - Links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of user views and which provide no value to the ZATech community.
 - Content infringing on copyright laws.

Content in the above categories will be immediately removed, and the poster in most cases will be banned without further warning from the Admin team.

## Discouraged content

Some content is discouraged by our community, though not illegal or covered under the Unacceptable Content guidelines above.

Whether in on-topic or off-topic channels, the following content is always strongly discouraged. 

The following categories of content are more heavily moderated and might be removed at the discretion of the Admin team.

People who repeatedly engage in conversations in the following topics might be banned from the community.

* Divisive and controversial content
* NSFW content
* Self promotional content
* Personal insults and vulgar language

Examples and more inforamtion about each of these is given below.

### Divisive and highly controversial content

These topics, while potentially interesting, have shown a tendency to lead to heated debates and conflicts within our community. To maintain a positive and productive environment, we strongly discourage extensive discussions on:

* Politics, including politicans (e.g. Trump good/bad), political parties (e.g. ANC good/bad), or political ideologies (e.g. Communism good/bad)
* Religion
* Controversial current events (e.g. COVID-19)
* Personal ideologies
* Divisive social issues

When these topics surface, members often struggle to maintain courteous and curious discussions. Such conversations often quickly escalate into conflicts, detracting from the community's primary purpose and potentially violating our code of conduct (personal attacks, trolling, etc).

It's important to note that we don't aim to create a precise list of disallowed behaviors or topics. Instead, we appeal to general values and the intended spirit of our community. This approach allows for flexibility and interpretation, recognizing that clear-cut rules can lead to semantic arguments and bureaucratic complexities.

There isn't anything more soul destroying than trying to codify every exact topic or context and hair-split every single interaction. This is to say that while there is a high level list of discouraged topics, a lot of very benign and common discussions can be classified under these labels. It isn't anyone's intention to crack down on every single one of these benign discussions. 

The admin team strives to avoid making value judgments on individual beliefs or ideologies. By discouraging certain topics, we aim to create an environment where the focus remains on our shared interests in technology, rather than potentially divisive subjects.

We ask members to be mindful of these guidelines and to avoid conversations that veer into discouraged territory. If you're unsure whether a topic is appropriate, please consult with an admin. Remember, interpretation of these guidelines is necessary, and the admin team is responsible for making these judgments to maintain the community's spirit.

Our goal is to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and productive environment for all members. By focusing on our shared interests in technology and maintaining respectful boundaries, we can ensure that ZATech remains a valuable resource for our community while avoiding the pitfalls of overly specific rules or bureaucratic processes.

#### Insults and disrespect

Name calling, vulgar language, and insults are not welcome on our platform. This is equally true whether you're talking to other members (e.g. "You're an idiot") or other people (e.g. "John Smith is an idiot"). You're welcome to express that you don't like something, but keep it professional and polite.

We strongly encourage everyone to engage in a respectful, professional way. This means being respectful and professional to other members of the community, but also to non-community members. For us, respect and professionalism has two aspects

- The content of the discussion (what you're saying)
- The tone and style of the discussion (how you're saying it)

If you're talking about unacceptable content as described in the section above, then it doesn't matter how eloquently or politely you phrase it, it is off topic and may be removed at the discretion of the admin team.

If you want to express that you disagree or don't like someone or something, then this should be done in a polite, constructive, and respectful fashion.

❌ Steve Jobs is an asshole who ruined Apple
✅ I think Steve Jobs' character and policies ruined Apple

❌ Only a retard would believe that
✅ I disagree with your opinion because A, B, C.
✅ I disagree with your opinion so I'll peace out of this one ✌️

**Name calling and insults**

We strictly do not allow any form of derogatory name calling or insulting. This includes people in and out of the community.

**Assume good intent**

Sometimes people will do the wrong thing in our community. Often (especially new members) are not aware of all of our norms. If someone does something you don't like, you should normally let them know directly before getting the Admin team involved in a disagreement, but you should

* Be friendly and polite
* Be respectful
* Assume that it was an honest mistake

For example, if someone posts in the #introductions channel 

> Hey all, I'm Bob, CTO at Acme and we're hiring devs. Also check out our great website!!

Then be nice and let them know about the norm:

✅ Hey Bob - please take a look at the channel topic. You'll notice that this channel is for introducing yourself to the community as a person. It's not for hiring or advertising your company. The @adminteam will probably remove this message.
❌ READ THE CHANNEL TOPIC BOB. @adminteam delete this.

#### NSFW

Anything with sexual or pornographic themes, whether implicit or explicit, is likely to be removed. If you wouldn't want your child to see it, it probably shouldn't be on ZATech.

#### Self promotion and messages that aim to extract value

Many people want things from a large community of technical professionals. In many cases, if you need help solving your problem, learning something, or asking for answers, you'll find the community very willing to oblige.

That said, we see a pattern of message from people who join mainly to encourage members from the community to perform some specific action. Some examples include:

* fill in my form/survey
* give me feedback on my product
* visit my website or read my article
* upvote or otherwise support my thing somewhere else
* apply to or attend this thing that I am promoting

All of these, and any other message that fits into a similar pattern, are strongly discouraged and may be deleted at the discretion of the admin team.

When deciding whether or not a message should be removed, we consider the following

* is the person posting the message a long-standing member of the community with a history of valuable contributions? If yes, then their request is probably OK. If it's a brand new account that joined just to post the promotional message, we'll likely remove.
* is the message in an appropriate channel? For things that you have built as an individual and want to share with the community, you can use #show. If you want to get input on a survey, we have #surveys. For companies, you can use #shameless-advertising. If your message is in one of these channels, it will be treated more leniently than if it is in the other channels. Again, these channels are mainly intended for people who are already part of the community to share things that they are involved in and want to promote, and if you join to only use these channels, your messages will likely be removed.
* is your message commercial or intended to lead to some monetary value somehow (buying, selling, signups to commercial products, including fremium ones, surveys on behalf of brands, etc)? We are more lenient, for example, on academic or non-profit surveys than on commercial ones.

As with divisive content, we deliberately do not codify exactly what is and isn't permitted around promotional messages as it just leads to bad actors finding loopholes and wasting our time. The admin team will use their discretion to remove promotional messages. If you aren't sure if your message will be classified as promotional, feel free to ask before posting.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all ZATech spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other ZATech members and/or the general public.

Intentionally evading exclusions, bans, suspensions, restrictions, or otherwise interfering with the admin team's decisions and actions are not permitted.

## Terms and Conditions

The Operators may, but are not obligated to, monitor or review any areas on the Slack where users transmit or post communications or communicate solely with each other, including but not limited to public and private channels, and the content of any such communications. The Operators, however, will have no liability related to the content of any such communications, whether or not arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy, obscenity, or otherwise. The Operators may edit or remove content on the the Slack at their discretion at any time.

## Privacy and AI-assisted moderation

By posting content on ZATech you are sharing that data with ZATech, with Slack, and with our partners. Members may report content to us that they think violates the code of conduct. Generally, all content is retained indefinitely. 

We further use tools such as LLMs to assist in moderating all content on the platform. Messages you send may be sent to OpenAI as part of our moderation automation tooling. Any such messages are retained by OpenAI for up to 30 days and are not used for training.
